This is a new program that uses profile Hidden Markov Models and multiple sequence alignments to predict that the given cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) will express blue, red, or yellow pigment. For more information on this model and the motivation please visit our teams wiki!

Blue bin = absorb above 600nm
Red bin = absorb from 550-600nm
