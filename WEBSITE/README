Access the user interface at http://ucdigem.pythonanywhere.com/
or create it youself with this directory:


Your directory needs to look like:

app.py
UPLOAD_FOLDER
script.py
red.hmm
blue.hmm
yellow.hmm
templates
	file.html
	index.html


Also, you may need to install hmmer for yours to work. (brew install hmmer)

Let me know if you have any questions.
